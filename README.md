# NON-SHOPPING
NON-SHOPPING is a simple Python-based shopping simulation where users select fruits, add them to a virtual basket, and pay using a limited balance. The program tracks purchased items, calculates total spending, updates the remaining balance, and displays the final results at the end of the session. It is designed as an easy, beginner-level project that demonstrates basic Python concepts such as input handling, loops, conditions, and list management.
